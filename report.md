# Towards a Question Answering System using Wikidata

*We present a prototype of a Question Answering system backed by WikiData. After the popular Freebase knowledge base was recently discontinued, and a migration to WikiData was started, many researchers have found difficulty in migrating their code to WikiData, as WikiData is substantially more complicated than Freebase. As well as our Question Answering prototype, therefore, we also present an introductory level tutorial to using WikiData, which we hope will assist the community in understanding WikiData and how to use it.*

## Introduction

Question Answering (QA) systems usually rely on a Knowledge Base (KB) — some kind of triple store with entries such as ("Donald Trump", "isPresidentOf", "United States of America"). These triples represent two entities and the relation that holds between them. A popular KB for QA systems was Freebase, a community built triple store maintained by Google. However, this was recently shut down and a migration was begun to Wikidata. 



## Comparing Natural Language Processing libraries in Python

Perhaps the most well-known Natural Language Processing (NLP) library in Python is the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK). Other libraries include Pattern and spaCy.

Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
